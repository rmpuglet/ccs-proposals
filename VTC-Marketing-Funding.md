# Proposal
Marketing is important in every aspect of the world. It enables businesses (and in this case the vertcoin community) to reach out to members in similar markets in order to increase awareness of themselves. Although the vertcoin community already contains many members, it is important that we continue to reach out to people already in the crypto space to make them aware of our project and how it works.

### Who is the target market?
In all forms of marketing, the target market is one of the most important aspects. It is important that we correctly identify who we want to reach out to. With this marketing campaign, I am going to be targeting both miners and gamers, who may be interested in potentially mining or investing in Vertcoin. With the upcoming merge of Ethereum into Ethereum 2.0, Ethereum miners will be one of the main targets in this specific campaign. The aim will be to build awareness among the Ethereum community to increase the chances of them choosing Vertcoin when Ethereum swithces to PoS. This campaign will also spread awareness among the gaming community, as many PC gamers will not know how easy it is to mine Vertcoin in the background whilst gaming.

### When will the Campaign start?
I am aiming to start the Campaign in mid July. The Ethereum merge will be occuring some time in August, so mid to late July will be the best time to spread awareness among the Ethereum Community. I started the fundraiser a month and a bit before this to give appropriate time to obtain funds for marketing.

### How will funds be spent?
The funds will be spent solely on Marketing Campaigns on each of the platforms. I won't be taking any cut for setting up Marketing Campaigns. I will also be setting up accounts on various platforms and reaching out to target markets with these accounts. It is undecided where 40% of the funds will be spent as of yet, and this will be decided at the time based on the cheapest and most effective way to reach out to target markets.

### Thanks for your time.
Thanks for reading this proposal, and I hope you will consider contributing a small proportion of your Vertcoin to aid the expansion of the community.
